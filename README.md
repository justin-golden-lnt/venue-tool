A simple venue generation tool for ALMA

https://justin-golden-lnt.github.io/venue-tool/

### USAGE

Just enter:

- Court Full Name

- County

- State

- Court Level

and the venue xml file will be generated for you.

You can use the generate button to output the XML below. The copy button will generate and copy the XML to your clipboard, and the download button will generate and download the XML as a txt file.

### NOTES

- Replace "replaceme" with the actual password in order to successfully upload the file (not added for security reasons)

- The output is saved as a .txt file instead of a .xml file for ease of use

### ADDING THE VENUE

Navigate to:

`ALMA > Setup > Tools > Xml Worksheet`

Then paste the XML code in and click "Post Data."

The message should say that it was inserted correctly. If an error is given, it is likely that you do not have the correct password for the `tc_xml` user.
